# TODO List for Adapting the Code

1. Modify Models/entrada.py:
   - Remove matplotlib import and graphical function
   - [x] Completed

2. Create Models/sistema_2x2.py:
   - Self-contained program for 2x2 systems
   - Input, display matrix, confirm, solve with steps
   - [x] Completed

3. Create Models/sistema_3x3.py:
   - Self-contained program for 3x3 systems
   - Input, display matrix, confirm, solve with steps
   - [x] Completed

4. Modify Models/sistema.py:
   - Add confirmation loop for matrix correctness
   - [x] Completed

5. Test the programs:
   - [x] Valid solutions for 2x2 and 3x3 with both methods
   - [x] No solution cases
   - [x] Infinite solutions cases
   - [x] Invalid input handling (asks for reinput)
   - [x] Confirmation 'no' loops back to input
   - [x] Matrix display in terminal
   - [x] Step-by-step solving
   - [x] Confirmation uses 'si/no' instead of 's/n'

6. Update TODO.md as tasks are completed
    - [x] Completed

7. Add fraction output alongside decimal
    - [x] Modified sistema_2x2.py, sistema_3x3.py, and sistema.py to show both decimal and fraction solutions
